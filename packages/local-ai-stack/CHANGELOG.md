# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Build and test every imported package on CPython 3.11 and 3.12 in hosted CI, including each package's own unit suite and repository checks.
- Require the imported-package matrix to pass before candidate attestation can run.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-18

- Preserve the existing `local-ai-stack` product, distribution, Python namespace and CLI identity while hardening it as an A03 flagship candidate.
- Pin the release build toolchain and test wheel plus source distribution as installed artifacts.
- Expand CI to Ubuntu, Windows and macOS across CPython 3.11 through 3.14.
- Preserve explicit positive, failed and blocked readiness evidence as the functional proof/counter-proof contract.
- Add SHA-256 release checksums, CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM, prepared-state evidence, and verified GitHub/Sigstore SLSA provenance.
- Add explicit publication-disable policy, migration, rollback, post-publication verification requirements and archive blockers.

`0.2.0` is PREPARED, not published. No tag, GitHub Release, package publication, archive, or deletion is implied.

## 0.1.0

- Initial deterministic fail-closed local runtime/model readiness evaluator and CLI.
