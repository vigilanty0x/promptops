# Local AI Stack

`observe` collects a bounded CPU/RAM/GPU/Ollama snapshot. `benchmark` explicitly
runs one to three small generations of a fixed synthetic prompt through the
existing model and inference lock. Missing measurements stay unknown; client
elapsed time and server-reported metrics remain distinct. GPU collection is
optional and requires a trusted existing executable selected by the operator.
See [Local observations and benchmark](docs/LOCAL-OBSERVATIONS.md). These
operations do not prove Docker health, port ownership or model quality.

`infer --fallback policy.json` optionally tries up to four explicitly ordered
local models under the same inference lock and total deadline. Each model must
appear in the observed inventory; only a complete terminal HTTP rejection can
permit the next candidate. Timeouts, broken connections and model mismatches
stop the chain. See [Local fallback](docs/LOCAL-FALLBACK.md). No circuit state,
model download or remote provider has been added.

## Integrated local runtime workflow (working-tree candidate)

The `doctor` and `infer` commands interrogate an existing Ollama runtime. They
do not install software or download models. The historical `record.json`
evaluator below remains compatible and validates supplied observations only.

```bash
local-ai-stack doctor --model qwen2.5:3b
local-ai-stack infer --model qwen2.5:3b --prompt "Reply with exactly OK." --max-tokens 8 --timeout 45 --lock /path/to/shared/ollama.lock
```

The same workflow checks the runtime version, obtains its inventory, requires
the exact installed model tag, acquires the configured OS inference lock, and
validates a complete generation from that model. `doctor` returns `available`
with `inference_readiness=not_measured`; only a finished generation returns
`completed`. Output includes actual elapsed time, token count and content
digests. A refusal returns no fabricated answer. Exit 0 means the requested
operation succeeded; exit 2 means blocked, timed out or invalid.

`CC_OLLAMA_BASE` or `--base` selects a local endpoint on port 11434. Only
loopback and the explicitly named Docker service `ollama` are accepted. The
transport pins an allowed resolved IP, ignores proxies, follows no redirects,
bounds JSON/body size, and shares one deadline across all stages. DNS and HTTP
also have deadline watchdogs. Remote provider APIs are unsupported.

Every process sharing a model must use **the same lock file/inode** through
`OLLAMA_INFERENCE_LOCK` or `--lock`; a Windows path and an unrelated Linux
volume are not interchangeable. Without an explicit path the private lock is
under `LOCAL_AI_STATE_ROOT` (default `.local-ai`). Private locks are created
with restrictive POSIX mode and existing permissions are never repaired.
The optional pre-provisioned shared-lock mode preserves stricter ownership
checks. See [runtime contract](docs/RUNTIME-WORKFLOW.md).

This working-tree addition is not a published version or an installed service.

Local AI Stack is a dependency-free, deterministic fail-closed readiness evaluator for local inference runtimes and models. It turns a bounded JSON observation into explicit `passed`, `failed`, or `blocked` evidence with a SHA-256 identifier instead of inferring that a local model is ready from process liveness alone.

**0.2.0 is PREPARED, not published.** `release-policy.v1.json` keeps publication disabled. See [Migration to 0.2](MIGRATION-0.2.md) and [Release contract](docs/RELEASE.md).

## Quick start

```bash
python -m pip install .
local-ai-stack --version
local-ai-stack record.json
```

Required fields are `runtime`, `model`, and `status`. The current root contract passes only when `status` is exactly `ready` and the runtime/model names are non-empty strings.

Example positive evidence:

```json
{"runtime":"ollama","model":"small","status":"ready"}
```

Counter-proof:

```json
{"runtime":"ollama","model":"small","status":"degraded"}
```

A missing required field is `blocked`, not success. The CLI exits `0` only for `passed`; failed/blocked evidence exits `2`.

## Consolidated local-AI utilities

The rehearsal preserves the histories and source trees of:

- `ollama-fleet-manager` → `packages/ollama-fleet-manager`
- `local-model-benchmark` → `packages/local-model-benchmark`
- `model-fallback-proxy` → `packages/model-fallback-proxy`

Consolidation is not archive authorization. Those source repositories remain subject to consumer, compatibility/redirect, rollback, and explicit human archive gates.

## Release-quality evidence

Flagship CI runs the root product on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS across CPython 3.11 through 3.14. A separate Ubuntu matrix builds the wheel and runs the unit suite plus repository checks for each of the three imported packages on its supported CPython 3.11 and 3.12 versions. Every root matrix job:

- installs an exact pinned build toolchain;
- builds wheel + source distribution;
- installs and tests the built wheel;
- verifies version/metadata and the positive/failed/blocked counter-proof contract;
- smokes the installed CLI outside the checkout;
- safely extracts and tests the complete sdist;
- verifies publication remains disabled;
- generates SHA-256 checksums, CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM, and `RELEASE_EVIDENCE.json` whose state remains `PREPARED` with release booleans false.

After all twelve root jobs and all six imported-package jobs pass, a guarded owner/same-repository job signs the canonical Ubuntu/Python 3.11 wheel with GitHub/Sigstore SLSA provenance and then independently verifies it with `gh attestation verify` constrained by repository, signer workflow, source ref, source digest and GitHub-hosted runner policy.

Attestation is evidence, not publication permission. Normal 0.2 CI contains no tag, GitHub Release or package-publish step.

## Verify locally

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/check.py
python scripts/check_release_policy.py
python -m compileall -q src tests scripts
```

## Rollback

0.2 changes release engineering and package verification, not persistent state. Rollback returns to the verified 0.1.0 artifact/commit and preserves the same product/distribution/namespace/CLI identity.

Apache-2.0. Python 3.11+; the root product is CI-tested through 3.14. Zero runtime dependencies.
